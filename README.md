# Yuval2k16

A project that me and some friends worked on in our 10th grade US History class. We had a project in which we simulated a mock election. My friends and I were the webmasters so we had to create a website for the campaign. This is the site that we created. My computer was having merge conflicts so we used a single computer for the majority of the project.
